# learning_go
## What is this?
This is a set of things I have written while learning GO
## How to play:
If you fork this repo, go into the first_project directory, there is a quick little guessing game. If you just want to see how the game works quickly, enter test as the player name. This will print the number the computer chose.
## Why play?
No reason to play, no reason not to play. It is just a fun little thing I did to check that I was retaining what I was learning.
## I want to help:
If you see something I could do better or just want to add something I missed:
1. Fork the Repo
2. Add/change your thing
3. Submit a PR to the dev branch
4. After I review it, I will merge it. I may ask questions about why it is better, I am just learning GO after all.
